On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed to coordinate with the overall look of your<br>
document. You can use these galleries to insert tables, headers, footers, lists, cover pages, and other<br>
document building blocks. When you create pictures, charts, or diagrams, they also coordinate with<br>
your current document look.<br>
